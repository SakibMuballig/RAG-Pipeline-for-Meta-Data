What is the difference between GAAP and non‑GAAP revenue figures?,"
Text context:
Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
To supplement our condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with generally 
accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: revenue 
excluding foreign exchange effect, advertising revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, and free cash flow. The presentation

of these financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information 
prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. Investors are cautioned that there are material limitations associated with the 
use of non-GAAP financial measures as an analytical tool. In addition, these measures may be different from non-GAAP

financial measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes. We compensate for these 
limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures.
We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial 
performance of our business, enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent

Answer the query:
What is the difference between GAAP and non‑GAAP revenue figures?
The difference between GAAP and non-GAAP revenue figures is that non-GAAP revenue figures exclude certain items, such as the impact of currency fluctuations, cost of acquired intangible assets, and the amortization of acquired intellectual property. GAAP revenue figures, on the other hand, may include these items and are based on the company's GAAP financial statements."
